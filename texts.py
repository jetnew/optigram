In case you didn’t already know, carbon emissions (CO2) are the #1 driver of global warming. And what is the greatest source of CO2 emissions? The answer: **energy consumption**. 

In 2018, energy consumption from oil is the greatest by far, at 4M kilotonnes of oil equivalent (ktoe), more than *double* that of electricity (2ktoe).

However, when it comes to electricity consumption, our households contribute a much larger proportion of about [14.9% of all electricity consumption in Singapore in 2019](https://www.ema.gov.sg/singapore-energy-statistics/Ch03/index3). This figure is projected to rise. 

If we look at who’s consuming the most electricity, we see that generally, [public housing consumes more electricity than private housing](https://www.ema.gov.sg/cmsmedia/Publications_and_Statistics/Publications/SES18/Publication_Singapore_Energy_Statistics_2018.pdf). Here’s a breakdown by housing type across the years: about 58.8% (4,287.2 GWh) of total consumption was by public housing units, while another 41.1% (2,999.3 GWh) was attributed to private housing units.
